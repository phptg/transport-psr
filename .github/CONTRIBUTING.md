# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to the `phptg/transport-psr` library!

## Reporting issues

Bug reports and feature requests are welcome via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/phptg/transport-psr/issues).
Please include the library version, the PHP version, the PSR-18 client and PSR-17 factories in use, and a minimal
snippet that reproduces the problem. For questions and discussion, use the author's
[Telegram chat](https://t.me/predvoditelev_chat).

## Development setup

Requirements: PHP 8.2–8.5 and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/).

Fork the repository, clone it and run `composer install`.

See [Internals](../docs/internals.md) for running tests, static analysis, code style and the other tools.

## Rules

- Runtime dependencies are limited to PSR interfaces and the tools required to build multipart requests. Adding
  anything else to the `require` section of `composer.json` needs a strong justification.
- The package must keep working with every `phptg/bot-api` version allowed in `composer.json`.
- Backward compatibility is preserved as much as possible. A new constructor or method parameter is always added
  **last**, with a default value.
- Tests live under `tests/`, mirroring the structure of `src/`.
- Every user-visible change needs a `CHANGELOG.md` entry under the topmost `under development` heading, in the
  form `- New #123: Add PsrUpdateFactory.`, where `#123` is the pull request number. Use `New` for new features,
  `Enh` for improvements, `Chg` for changes affecting existing usage, `Bug` for fixes.
- Update the documentation (`README.md`, `docs/`) when behavior or the public API changes.

## Pull requests

Keep pull requests focused on a single change and make sure all CI checks pass.
